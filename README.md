## Simple ticketing system

Test task to evaluate knowledge of React and Javascript. Link to task description you can find [here](https://github.com/nmurzin/simple-ticketing-system/blob/master/Simple%20ticketing%20system.pdf). 

This system consists of two parts - back and front:
-  Back-end was developed using typescript and express+sequelize. 
-  Front-end was developed using react and es6. 

You can deploy this system on your local environment using docker and docker-compose. For that simply run in the project root:

`make start`

By default back-end will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`, front-end at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`
